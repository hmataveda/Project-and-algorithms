Recursion=>

instead of looping use recursion...
recursion is repeating/calling the same function inside that function by changing the arguments.
we have to end the function repeating / recursion by adding the condition to return/exit the function.

number is leap number
if it is evenly divisible by 4,=> leap yeaar
if it is evenly divisible by 4 and 100 => may or may not be
if it is evenly divisible by 4 and 100 but not 400 => not a leap year
if it is evenly divisible by 4 and 100 and 400 => leap year!!
